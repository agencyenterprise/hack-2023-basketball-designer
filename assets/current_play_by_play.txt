Step 1: The play begins with the point guard (PG) at the top of the key, dribbling towards the right wing. The power forward (PF) is positioned at the low post but moves to the top of the key. The small forward (SF) is at the right wing but moves down to the right corner. The shooting guard (SG) is at the left wing. The center (C) is at the left low post. The ball is with the PG.

Step 2: As the PG dribbles towards the right wing, the defense shifts towards the ball side. The PF is now at the top of the key, the SF is in the right corner, the SG is at the left wing, and the C is in the high post. The ball is still with the PG.

Step 3: The PG passes the ball to the PF who is at the top of the key. The SF remains in the right corner, the SG at the left wing, and the C moves to the high post. The ball is now with the PF.

Step 4: The PF finds the C in the high post and passes the ball to him. The SF starts cutting towards the baseline from the right corner. The SG remains at the left wing. The ball is now with the C.

Step 5: Now, the C has three options. He can either shoot a jumper, pass the ball to the SF who is cutting to the baseline from the right corner, or pass the ball back out to the SG who is at the left wing. The PG is at the right wing, and the PF is at the top of the key. The ball is with the C, and the next move depends on his decision.

At the end of this play, the PG is at the right wing, the PF is at the top of the key, the SF is cutting to the baseline from the right corner, the SG is at the left wing, and the C is at the high post with the ball.
