Step 1: 
The play starts with the point guard (#1) at the top of the key with the ball. The rest of the team is spread out across the court: the center (#5) is on the low block, the power forward (#4) is on the opposite low block, the shooting guard (#2) is on the wing, and the small forward (#3) is on the opposite wing.

Step 2: 
The point guard (#1) begins to dribble towards the right wing where the shooting guard (#2) is positioned. The center (#5) moves up from the low block to set a screen for #1 at the right elbow of the free throw line. The power forward (#4) moves up from the opposite low block to set a screen for the shooting guard (#2) at the left elbow of the free throw line.

Step 3: 
The point guard (#1) uses the screen set by the center (#5) to drive towards the basket. This movement draws the attention of the defense towards #1. Simultaneously, the shooting guard (#2) uses the screen set by the power forward (#4) to cut towards the top of the key, getting open for a potential pass from #1. The small forward (#3) stays on the opposite wing, ready to move if needed.

Step 4: 
As the point guard (#1) drives to the basket, he draws the defense in, creating an open shot for the shooting guard (#2). The point guard (#1) passes the ball to the shooting guard (#2) who is now positioned at the top of the key. The center (#5) and power forward (#4) roll off their screens, with #5 moving towards the basket and #4 moving towards the left wing. The small forward (#3) remains on the opposite wing.

Step 5: 
The shooting guard (#2) receives the pass from the point guard (#1) and takes the open shot from the top of the key. The center (#5) positions himself for a potential offensive rebound, while the power forward (#4) and small forward (#3) spread out along the perimeter to be ready for a potential kick-out pass if the shot is missed.

At the end of the play, the shooting guard (#2) is at the top of the key with the ball, the point guard (#1) is near the basket, the center (#5) is under the basket, the power forward (#4) is on the left
