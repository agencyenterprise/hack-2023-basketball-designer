Step 1: 
The play begins with the point guard (#1) at the top of the key, holding the ball. The shooting guard (#2) is positioned on the weak side wing, the small forward (#3) is in the corner on the strong side, the power forward (#4) is on the elbow of the free throw line on the weak side, and the center (#5) is on the elbow of the free throw line on the strong side.

Step 2: 
The point guard (#1) starts dribbling towards the strong side (where the center is). Simultaneously, the center (#5) moves to set a screen for #1 on the defender. At this point, #1 is near the three-point line on the strong side, #5 is setting the screen near the free throw line, and the ball is with #1.

Step 3: 
The point guard (#1) uses the screen set by the center (#5) to drive towards the basket. This movement draws the attention of the defense towards #1. Meanwhile, the power forward (#4) moves to set a screen for the shooting guard (#2) on the weak side. At this point, #1 is driving towards the basket, #5 is rolling off the screen towards the basket, #4 is setting a screen on the weak side wing, and #2 is preparing to use the screen.

Step 4: 
The shooting guard (#2) uses the screen set by the power forward (#4) to cut towards the perimeter on the weak side. This movement leaves #2 open for a pass from #1. At this point, #1 is near the basket, #2 is open on the perimeter, #4 is rolling off the screen towards the basket, and the ball is with #1.

Step 5: 
The point guard (#1), seeing the shooting guard (#2) open, passes the ball to #2. At this point, #1 is near the basket, #2 is on the perimeter ready to receive the pass, #4 and #5 are near the basket, and the ball is in the air heading towards #2.

Step 6: 
The shooting guard (#2) receives the pass from #1 and takes an open shot from the perimeter. At this point, #1 is near the basket, #2 is on the perimeter with the ball, #4 and #5 are near the basket, and the ball is in #2's hands as he shoots.
